Progress log - My first project

This is a small project to showcase my newfound knowledge on programming.
This is a tiny step for manking but huge one for me. My aim is to alternate
my current carrer path and finally do something that feels fullfilling and 
important for the world. The road ahead is long and sometimes it might get lonely
but someday i will reach my long forgotten Ithaca.

   <h3>How to make the most tasty lasagna</h3>
   
   <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish 
     to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. 
     Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>

   <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. 
     Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. 
     What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
